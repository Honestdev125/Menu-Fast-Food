Restaurant Menu Project üçîüçï‚òï

This is a restaurant menu web application with multiple features and a responsive design.

Features:

Home Page with a slider for images

Navigation Bar (NavBar) for easy page navigation

Shopping Cart to add, remove, and manage food items (using Zustand for state management)

Menu Page with product filtering by category (Pizza, Burger, Coffee, etc.)

Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

Technologies Used:

React for building UI components

Next.js for server-side rendering and routing

TypeScript for type safety and better code quality

Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive styling

Zustand for global state management (cart state, quantities, etc.)

Description:

This project demonstrates a modern web application for a restaurant menu. Users can browse food items, filter by category, add items to the cart, and see a responsive and interactive UI. The shopping cart is managed using Zustand, making state management simple and efficient.

This project is perfect for practicing React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand in a real-world scenario.

If you want, I can also make a compact README version ready to paste directly into your GitHub repository. Do you want me to do that?
